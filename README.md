# Calibrate_Stepper_Wheel
This is a code to calibrate the position of a wheel attached on a stepper motor. There is a magnet attached in the wheel and a hall effect sensor is placed on the fixed platform on which the whole stepper mechanism is placed. I am not using any library because I dont like the unknown processes takes place in the backend.
